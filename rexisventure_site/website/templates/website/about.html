        <h1>Focused on getting the right products where they matter most.</h1>
        <p>
            Rexis Venture Inc was founded on a simple idea: organizations that do critical work should not have
            to fight through fragmented supply chains to get the safety, industrial and lab products they need.
        </p>
        <p>
            We combine a lean structure with a focused supplier network to offer a single, accountable partner
            that can align product selection, delivery and communication with your mission.
        </p>

                    <li><strong>Listen first:</strong> we start by understanding your environment, constraints and the people who will use the products.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curate, then scale:</strong> we match product sets to actual needs, then scale that approach across sites or programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manage the details:</strong> from order entry through delivery and follow-up, we handle the operational complexity.</li>
